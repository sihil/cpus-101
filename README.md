CPU Time
========

Some files and explanations for a short and fun introduction to how CPUs work and how you can make a CPU do what you want with assembly language.

Some materials that will be of use throughout this session:
 - A simple 8-bit assembler and simulator: https://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/
 - Summary of the assembly instructions it supports: https://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/instruction-set.html
 - A complete list of opcodes: https://github.com/Schweigi/assembler-simulator/blob/master/src/emulator/opcodes.js
 - The assembler that turns assembly code into a binary program: https://github.com/Schweigi/assembler-simulator/blob/master/src/assembler/asm.js
